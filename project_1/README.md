# Project 1 - Using MTA data to recommend the best stations for exposure

Team members: Sam, Luke, Rishi, Skyler

This folder contains the files for our first Metis project.

Coordinates Project 1 pulls the coordinates for the stations (MTA Stations.CSV) for the geographic filtering. It also contains the coordinates for Silicon Alley and the nucleus of tech companies. It can be used to output a list of MTA Stations in Silicon Alley.  
Project 1 - Filtering Traffic pulls in turnstile data, scrubs the data and performs basic EDA, and pickles it for later exploration.   
Benson_Visualization reads in the pickled turnstile data and explores the MTA foot traffic. It groups by Station and by date to identify stations with the greatest mean ridership and provides the information needed to make a recommendation to the client.    
The included .pdf file contains our presentation to the class.
